  ## Hi, I'm Jangwon Lee, a developer who values freedom, creativity, and the joy of building what truly matters.  

  I was first introduced to programming in middle school through a visual coding platform called Entry.
  What began as a simple classroom activity quickly sparked a deeper curiosity. I want to understand what was behind the blocks, how they worked, and what made them possible.  
  
  That early curiosity has grown into a long-standing passion for software development.
  
  Today, I'm working toward becoming a full-stack developer who knows how to integrate AI where it matters most to build more efficient, maintainable, and meaningful systems.  
  
  From exploring basic logic to understanding real-world architecture, I've always aimed to go one step deeper.
  I believe in writing code that not only works but also lasts. And I'm excited to keep growing through hands-on experience and constant learning.
