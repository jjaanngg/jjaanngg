  ## Hi, I'm Jangwon Lee, a full-stack developer who values **three things**:
  1. **Always moving forward**
  2. **Getting the details right**
  3. **Finding joy in building what truly matters**
<br/>

  I was first introduced to programming in middle school through a visual coding platform called Entry. What began as a simple classroom activity quickly sparked a deeper curiosity about how things worked behind the scenes‚Äîhow blocks became logic, and how that logic turned into something real.

Since then, I‚Äôve pursued software development with both meticulous attention to detail and a strong sense of responsibility. I‚Äôm not someone who skims over things‚ÄîI dive deep, verify thoroughly, and make sure every step is solid before moving on.

What drives me most is the process of building and structuring a project from scratch to keeping everything and everyone on track. Whether I‚Äôm collaborating or leading a team, I actively step up to coordinate, align, and ensure no one is left behind. While many shy away from the pressure of leading, I find energy in it. I enjoy taking ownership, supporting my teammates, and balancing both momentum and stability in any project.

Today, I'm working toward becoming a full-stack developer who can integrate AI where it matters most‚Äîto build systems that are not only efficient and maintainable, but meaningful. From exploring basic logic to understanding real-world architecture, I always aim to go one step deeper. I believe in writing code that not only works, but endures. And I‚Äôm excited to keep learning through hands-on experience.
