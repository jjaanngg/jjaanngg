  ## Hi, I'm Jangwon Lee, a developer who values freedom, creativity, and the joy of building what truly matters.  

  I was first introduced to programming in middle school through a visual coding platform called Entry.
  What began as a simple classroom activity quickly sparked a deeper curiosity. I want to understand what was behind the blocks, how they worked, and what made them possible.  
  
  That early curiosity ha grown into a long-standing passion for software development.
  
  Today, I'm working toward becoming a full-stack developer who knows how to integrate AI where it matters most to build more efficient, maintainable, and meaningful systems.  
  
  From exploring basic logic to understanding real world architecture, I've always tried to go one step deeper.
  I believe in writing code that not only works but also lasts. And I'm excied to keep growing through hands-on experience and constant learning.
